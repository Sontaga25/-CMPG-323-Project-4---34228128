# -CMPG-323-Project-4---

Below is a genenric step by step guide  on how to use the workflow sequences 

This  project consists of multiple xaml files each adhring to what was asked of us in the project brief. The xaml files are name intuitvely and descipttively and self explantory e.g "sequeence to delete the Devices" is a sequence to delete the all the devices in the database
 
 
Whne each of the scripts are ran

they all the script will autatically run the login process using hard coded enail  address and passwords ( foraneg@gmail.com and Giftforane1@ respectively )

The script for adding records for Devices, Zones and categorries are all in one xaml file called "Add_All_records"

then the xamle files for updating and deleting files in the respective xaml files , in other words the sequence for deleting devices and deleting categories are in the seperater xamle file.

Hence when a specific sequence needs to be tested or  run please negaviate to the respective xaml file
